0. Normalize the brightness: Run on 10-15 scans of empty OMRs for threshold tuning
> Can you plot the histogram on single image?
--> Yeah, that's skewed! Shud use the full spectrum! 
> Is it bad? Actually the black is on the left, white is on the right thats good.
> The gray is black too rn, it will gray out. 
> Gray= 127-->80-->53.82(BGLR_JE_03,healthy, maxB 42, avgW  in that case. Usually maxB ~30, avgW ~ 220)
> Black= 50-->48

#### Conclusions
O = Healthy
X = Bad
M = higherExt
m = lowerExt

Description			maxB avgB minW avgW 
Slight Shift		 O	   O	m	O
Risky But Works		 M 	   O 	m 	X  <--- JE_05 vs JE_04 Bangalore

Gap between gray and black as HEALTH/CONFIDENCE MEASURE?

## Curr Tasks
### 1) Run the outputs into omr detector.
	1.1 [X] Rescale Thresholds into 0-255 range
	1.2 [X] Show clr vals at the boxes.
	1.3 [X] Readjust threshold values
	1.4 [X] Show b4_after comparision

### 2) For multi marks: Local variance measure to determine multimarked. > Can you plot the threshold distribution?
	2.1 Refactor readResponse and template to suit question-wise detection
		>> NOPE, rather create ans key from template: Create from answer key 
			// Derive template from ans? - nope. Some may want 1,2,3,4 as option numbers
			// Merge anskey into template? - nope. Why add this constraint? May fail at unforeseen situation?!
		>> Have a separate json for coords.
		>> Main thing is: qNo,point,qType <- lets make a class.

	Work on full scale, write bigger font, then scale down at the end.
