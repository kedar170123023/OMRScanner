0. Normalize the brightness: Run on 10-15 scans of empty OMRs for threshold tuning
> Can you plot the histogram on single image?
--> Yeah, that's skewed! Shud use the full spectrum! 
> Is it bad? Actually the black is on the left, white is on the right thats good.
> The gray is black too rn, it will gray out. 
> Gray= 127-->80-->53.82(BGLR_JE_03,healthy, maxB 42, avgW  in that case. Usually maxB ~30, avgW ~ 220)
> Black= 50-->48

#### Conclusions
O = Healthy
X = Bad
M = higherExt
m = lowerExt

Description			maxB avgB minW avgW 
Slight Shift		 O	   O	m	O
Risky But Works		 M 	   O 	m 	X  <--- JE_05 vs JE_04 Bangalore

Gap between gray and black as HEALTH/CONFIDENCE MEASURE?


** FOUND MAJOR CAUSE FOR TEMPLATE SHIFT:
	> It's not about scan being of a curved paper. The print itself is wrong. The xerox machine got the curved paper! Coz this is happening only with some xeroxes (no normal prints).
	> It's a proper scan of improper print

## Curr Tasks
### 1) Run the outputs into omr detector.
	1.1 [X] Rescale Thresholds into 0-255 range
	1.2 [X] Show clr vals at the boxes.
	1.3 [X] Readjust threshold values
	1.4 [X] Show b4_after comparision

### 2) For multi marks: Local variance measure to determine multimarked. > Can you plot the threshold distribution?
[ ]	2.0  Nope, they gone- Gather 5 images on which current code detects false multi marks
		> Rather increase the THR to obtain multimarks
			thresholdRead_L =  145 # 110 # if kv else 120
			thresholdRead_R =  77 # 50 
			Found JE Bangalore Series to fail on this.

[X] 2.1 Refactor Template to suit question-wise detection
	>> Main thing is: qNo,point,qType <- lets make a Q class _/
		// Derive template from ans? - nope. Some may want 1,2,3,4 as option numbers
		// Merge anskey into template? - nope. Why add this constraint? May fail at unforeseen situation?!
		>> NOPE: Create from answer key. // rather create ans key from template
	[X] Scale the coords onto high res image.
	[ ] Give feedback on adjusting template to make scaleRange near 1

[ ]	2.2 Refactor readResponse 


[ ]	2.3 Implement local variance
	[X]	lets Plot the hist!
		[:28]> First make Q Class
		[:30]> Modify template code
		[:42]	> As we're likely to use outer rect boxes, keep support for a qNoList for multi qs in the rect at gaps[1]
			### DESIGN CHOICE
			C1) Current template making 
				+Faster to make in ideal situations
				+Superset of below
				~More complex rects makeable in less data
				-Stubborn
				+Template fitting is robust - all or none
			C2) Individiual Question Coords
				+Simple
				~Code repetition --> Actually is healthy here as the region is active!
				-Slightly slower
				-More user clicks required
				+eliminates gaps[1]
				~On curvy papers this would disturb only some questions
				+Can be copy pasted in future <- seamlessness support
				+Class support easy <- for histograms!
			Verdict: C2 _/_/
			"""
			New Input:
			start coord, type for each question
			gapX, gapY be fixed for a Q type in the template -Nope-its also supported by core fn_/ _/ Supportable by fixed mini-templates later
			numX, numY removed and hardcoded.
			>> Need a Pt class to contain coord and read-value

			New Output
			Array of Q objects

			"""
		[+24 2:12]> Subplot Hist for each Q <- or maybe that candlestick one
			>> Finds that first bar of the histogram indicates correctly marked vals

[X]	Work on full scale, write bigger font, then scale down at the end.
