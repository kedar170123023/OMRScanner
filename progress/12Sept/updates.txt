This week's updates:
0. Created Question(Q) and Point(Pt) classes for ease
1. Restructured template making system to generate coordinates grouped by QNo (Previously no grouping was there)
2. Converted and fit the templates to JSON format (Side-effect of above task)
3. Obtained questionwise box readings, plotted boxplots(and histograms) for each question.
4. Plots for different types of OMRs are as follows:
	[Attached images]
	Red line indicates threshold used.
	The edgy case can now be resolved by making use of this variance (in progress)
5. I'm artifically generating some cases for which the code should work but doesn't work, will test above method on them to see for improvement
