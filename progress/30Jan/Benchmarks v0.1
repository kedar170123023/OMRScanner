### Limits of current algorithm:
## Translation limits
Expected:  As long as circles are visible and in their respective quadrants
Actual1: Inconsistent detections
--> Quadrants optimization was not configured at midpoint. Now resolved.
Actual2: Still a few unexpected ones - Circles in quadrants but still wrong detections('lon' problem)

## Rotation limits
> Note: Quadrant division can't be used for extreme cases! But then 'lon' prob will come again. We shall have this as input requirement in the specification
Expected: (-17,17) degrees as it uses quadrants approach
Actual1: (-30, 20)?!
--> The generated cases do not have OMR at exact centre. Now resolved (bug in rotateImg).
Actual2: (-17, 17) _/_/

## Warping limits
> Note: Yet to be implemented
Expected: 
Actual:
