# OMR-Scanner
A full-fledged OMR checking software that can read and evaluate OMR sheets scanned at any angle and having any color. With support for a customizable marking scheme with section-wise marking, bonus questions, etc.

# How it works
1. An OMR Sheet is scanned.
2. The scanned image is preprocessed

3. Four corner circles are detected

4. Image is then cropped and transformed using those four points and the distribution of intensity values at the question bubbles is used to identify a threshold.

5. Marked bubbles are detected and forwarded to the evaluator.

This work is actively in progress and many improvements are being done.

## TODOs
[X] Normalize the brightness: Run on 10-15 scans of empty OMRs for threshold tuning

> Can you plot the histogram on single image? _/_/

[X] For multi marks: Write algo to check threshold locally - variance values

> Can you plot the threshold distribution? _/_/

[ ] For shifted templ: Find out methods to force align on rectangular strips
	> Will need edge detection here?!

> Prob- some given scans also have negligible bg strips

## Curr Tasks
### 1) Run the outputs into omr detector.
	1.1 [X] Rescale Thresholds into 0-255 range
	1.2 [X] Show intensity vals at the boxes.
	1.3 [X] Readjust threshold values
	1.4 [X] Show b4_after comparision
(28-30Aug 2018)

### 2) Redesign the template making code.
	2.1 [X] Make Q and Pt class
	2.2 [X] Rethink and implement grid gen functions
	2.3 [X] Fit the template for ints
	2.4 [X] JSONify the template
	2.5 [X] Fit the template for mcq and rolls
(11-12 Sept 2018)

### 3) Plot for each question
	3.1 [X] Change readResponse to adapt to Q class
	3.2 [X] Make hist subplots
	3.3 [X] Make boxplot subplots _/_/
	3.4 [X] Record/Report the progress
(12 Sept 2018)

### 4) Implement local variance

### 5) Check for more improvements

### 6) Testbench generation

### 7) Refactor readResponse completely
	7.1 [ ] Simplify resp array generation
	7.2 [ ] Simplify detection process
	7.3 [ ] Minimize logging 

### 8) Make use of rectangular strips
	8.1 Think how would it be beneficial
	8.2 Find what methods are used to do this
	8.3 Think of adding it in code
