# OMR-Scanner
A full-fledged OMR checking software that can read and evaluate OMR sheets scanned at any angle and having any color. With support for a customizable marking scheme with section-wise marking, bonus questions, etc. 

## TODOs
0. Run on 10-15 scans of empty OMRs for threshold tuning
	>> Normalize the brightness
2. Write algo to check threshold locally - variance values
3. Find out methods to force align on rectangular strips
