warpAffine vs warpPerspective

warpAffine
> Input M is 2x3
> Affine means all parallel lines in original image will still be parallel in output image
> M is generated from getAffineTransform, which needs two sets of 3 points
>> It can effectively scale, rotate and skew(in a particular direction) the image


warpPerspective
> Input M is 3x3
> Lines no longer may remain parallel, but atleast remain straight lines
> M is generated from getPerspectiveTransform, which needs two sets of 4 points
>> It can skew non uniformly.


Find Contour vs Template Matching

Find Contour
> Wont work for scanner images as no bounding contour exists - has to detect that somehow.
> Slower

Template Matching
> (currently) wont work for images with larger tilts in angle

>> Using contour for inner boxes will help
